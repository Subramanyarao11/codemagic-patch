// What to do about a server problem, in this CLI's commands.
//
// The server states the problem and leaves the remedy to whoever asked: it
// answers `cmpatch`, `cmpatch-capacitor` and the dashboard from the same
// routes, so a sentence naming a `cmpatch` command could only ever be right for
// one of the three. It is also self-hosted, which means a server installed
// today still answers CLIs released years from now — and only the program that
// defines a command can still name it correctly by then.
//
// The top-level `reason` is the whole key: it is the stable machine-readable
// code, where the prose is wording the server is free to change. Its absence
// matters just as much. A server old enough not to send it is a server whose
// `detail` still spells out the `cmpatch` command to run, so adding a hint
// there would say the same thing twice.
